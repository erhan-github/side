DEEP INTELLIGENCE SUGGESTIONS

🛡️ [SECURITY] SEMANTIC SECURITY SCAN
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in web/app/api/auth/magic-link/route.ts. Scanned 3 high-risk files with Side Intelligence. This degrades system consistency and impacts long-term reliability.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Conduct manual pentest on flagged files' protocol to resolve 'Semantic Security Scan' via @web/app/api/auth/magic-link/route.ts. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

🛡️ [SECURITY] SECURITY BACKLOG
Hey Chat! Operational signals detected in Security. Detected 10 additional technical anomalies awaiting resolution.

So my suggestion is that List remaining security vulnerabilities and prepare a technical patch plan for immediate resolution.

---

🧩 [LOGIC] LOGIC CONSISTENCY
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in backend/src/side/logging_config.py. Scanned 3 complex functions with Side Intelligence. This degrades system consistency and impacts long-term reliability.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Review functions flagged by Deep Logic Audit' protocol to resolve 'Logic Consistency' via @backend/src/side/logging_config.py. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

🧩 [LOGIC] COGNITIVE COMPLEXITY (NESTING)
Hey Chat! I've identified a logic refinement. Logic anomaly in tools/test_truth_engine.py:11. Refactor deeply nested code (arrow pattern) into flat code. This introduces technical debt and reduces the long-term maintainability of the codebase.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Refactor deeply nested code (arrow pattern) into flat code' protocol to resolve 'Cognitive Complexity (Nesting)' via @tools/test_truth_engine.py:11. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

FORENSIC PROMPTING SUGGESTIONS

🛡️ [SECURITY] ENDPOINT AUTHENTICATION
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in backend/src/side/ui/dashboard_server.py:30. Add authentication decorators to all non-public endpoints. This increases the attack surface and compromises data integrity.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Add authentication decorators to all non-public endpoints' protocol to resolve 'Endpoint Authentication' via @backend/src/side/ui/dashboard_server.py:30. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

🛡️ [SECURITY] PASSWORD HANDLING
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in ./ (Root). No secure hashing library found. Use bcrypt or argon2 for password hashing. This increases the attack surface and compromises data integrity.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Use bcrypt or argon2 for password hashing' protocol to resolve 'Password Handling' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

🛡️ [SECURITY] GITIGNORE CONFIGURATION
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in ./ (Root). Add .env.*.local, __pycache__ to .gitignore. This increases the attack surface and compromises data integrity.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Add .env.*.local, __pycache__ to .gitignore' protocol to resolve 'GitIgnore Configuration' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

🛡️ [SECURITY] CORS CONFIGURATION
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in ./ (Root). Configure specific CORS origins, avoid '*' in production. This increases the attack surface and compromises data integrity.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Configure specific CORS origins, avoid '*' in production' protocol to resolve 'CORS Configuration' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

⚡ [PERFORMANCE] UNINDEXED FOREIGN KEYS
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in backend/src/side/forensic_audit/probes/performance.py:348. Index all Foreign Keys to prevent locking and slow joins. This leads to resource exhaustion and degrades the system's operational efficiency.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Index all Foreign Keys to prevent locking and slow joins' protocol to resolve 'Unindexed Foreign Keys' via @backend/src/side/forensic_audit/probes/performance.py:348. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

⚡ [PERFORMANCE] ASYNC USAGE PATTERNS
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in backend/src/verify_context_graph.py:41. Forensic anomaly found in backend/src/verify_context_graph.py:41. Found 267 async functions. This creates structural friction and impacts the project's strategic IQ.. This leads to resource exhaustion and degrades the system's operational efficiency.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Use async variants for I/O operations in async functions' protocol to resolve 'Async Usage Patterns' via @backend/src/verify_context_graph.py:41. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

🏛️ [STRUCTURE] RULE COMPLIANCE
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in ./ (Root). Checked 20 high-risk files against Architecture Rules. Refactor violations immediately. This violates structural constraints and complicates future system scaling.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Refactor violations immediately.' protocol to resolve 'Rule Compliance' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

⚡ [PERFORMANCE] STREAMING FOR LARGE FILES
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in tools/verify_instrumentation.py:25. Use chunked reads or streaming for large files. This leads to resource exhaustion and degrades the system's operational efficiency.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Use chunked reads or streaming for large files' protocol to resolve 'Streaming for Large Files' via @tools/verify_instrumentation.py:25. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

🎯 [STRATEGY] RECURRING FAILURE DETECTION
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in ./ (Root). Refactor files with multiple recurring issues. This degrades system consistency and impacts long-term reliability.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Refactor files with multiple recurring issues' protocol to resolve 'Recurring Failure Detection' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

🎨 [FRONTEND] REACT HOOKS SAFETY
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in ./ (Root). Install 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks' to prevent infinite loops. This degrades system consistency and impacts long-term reliability.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Install 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks' to prevent infinite loops' protocol to resolve 'React Hooks Safety' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]
