DEEP INTELLIGENCE SUGGESTIONS

🛡️ [SECURITY] SECURITY BACKLOG
Hey Chat! Operational signals detected in Security. Detected 17 additional technical anomalies awaiting resolution.

So my suggestion is that List remaining security vulnerabilities and prepare a technical patch plan for immediate resolution.

---

🧩 [LOGIC] ERROR HANDLING COVERAGE
Hey Chat! I've identified a logic refinement. Logic anomaly in ./ (Root). 0.0% of functions have try/except (0/41). This introduces technical debt and reduces the long-term maintainability of the codebase.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Add error handling to critical paths (>30% coverage target)' protocol to resolve 'Error Handling Coverage' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

🧩 [LOGIC] DOCSTRING COVERAGE
Hey Chat! I've identified a logic refinement. Logic anomaly in ./ (Root). 0.0% of public functions have docstrings (0/41). This introduces technical debt and reduces the long-term maintainability of the codebase.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Add docstrings to all public functions (>50% target)' protocol to resolve 'Docstring Coverage' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

FORENSIC PROMPTING SUGGESTIONS

🛡️ [SECURITY] GITIGNORE CONFIGURATION
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in ./ (Root). This increases the attack surface and compromises data integrity.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Create .gitignore with standard entries' protocol to resolve 'GitIgnore Configuration' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

🛡️ [SECURITY] PASSWORD HANDLING
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in ./ (Root). No secure hashing library found. This increases the attack surface and compromises data integrity.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Use bcrypt or argon2 for password hashing' protocol to resolve 'Password Handling' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

🛡️ [SECURITY] INPUT VALIDATION
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in ./ (Root). No validation library detected. This increases the attack surface and compromises data integrity.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Use Pydantic or similar for all API input validation' protocol to resolve 'Input Validation' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

🛡️ [SECURITY] CSRF PROTECTION
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in ./ (Root). No CSRF protection detected. This increases the attack surface and compromises data integrity.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Add Flask-WTF CSRFProtect or Django CSRF middleware' protocol to resolve 'CSRF Protection' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

🛡️ [SECURITY] SECURITY HEADERS
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in ./ (Root). This increases the attack surface and compromises data integrity.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Configure security headers in your web server or middleware' protocol to resolve 'Security Headers' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

🛡️ [SECURITY] SESSION SECURITY
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in ./ (Root). This increases the attack surface and compromises data integrity.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Configure session timeout and secure cookie flags' protocol to resolve 'Session Security' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

🛡️ [SECURITY] SESSION TIMEOUT
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in ./ (Root). No session timeout found. This increases the attack surface and compromises data integrity.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Set PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME to reasonable value (e.g., 30 minutes)' protocol to resolve 'Session Timeout' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

⚡ [PERFORMANCE] DATABASE CONNECTION POOLING
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in ./ (Root). No connection pooling found. This leads to resource exhaustion and degrades the system's operational efficiency.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Use SQLAlchemy with pool_size or similar for production' protocol to resolve 'Database Connection Pooling' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

🧭 [DATABASE] ROW LEVEL SECURITY
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in ./ (Root). Found 0/1 tables with RLS enabled. This degrades system consistency and impacts long-term reliability.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Enable RLS on all tables containing sensitive user data' protocol to resolve 'Row Level Security' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]

---

🧭 [DATABASE] BACKUP STRATEGY
Hey Chat! I've detected a technical improvement. Structural anomaly in ./ (Root). No backup strategy detected. This degrades system consistency and impacts long-term reliability.

So my suggestion is that Implement 'Implement automated backups with retention policy' protocol to resolve 'Backup Strategy' via @.. [Hardened Logic | Zero Side-Effects]
