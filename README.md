# Sidelith: The Engineering Flight Recorder 🏛️

> **The System of Record for Engineering Intent.** 

In 2026, velocity is no longer the bottleneck—**understanding** is. As AI agents flood repositories with generated code, Sidelith captures the "failed attempts," "chat context," and "strategic rationale" that make software maintainable.

## 🏛️ The Sovereign Moats

| Moat | Description | Value Prop |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Heritage Search** | 3D visual reconstruction of logic evolution. | Instant onboarding; 100% tribal knowledge retention. |
| **Sovereign Privacy** | Local-first "Judicial Scrubber" for PII/Secrets. | Enterprise-grade IP protection (SOC2 ready). |
| **Intent Mapping** | Physical links between code (AST) and Business Why. | Automatic drift detection; architectural circuit breaker. |
| **Deployment Intel** | Pre-flight checks for platform-specific "gotchas". | Prevents "it works on my machine" production failures. |
| **SU Economy** | Pay for "Expert Reasoning" (Strategic Units), not CPU. | High-leverage economics for engineering audits. |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. The God-View Dashboard
Visualize the logic fabric and strategic links in real-time.
```bash
# From /backend
python src/side/ui/dashboard_server.py
```
*Access: `http://localhost:8080`*

### 2. The Forensic Audit
Run a multi-language AST-level scan for security, arch-purity, and performance.
```bash
# Via Side MCP
side audit
```
