# 🦅 Sidelith: The Sovereign Context Engine

> **"117M Match/Sec Search. Clean Strategic DNA. Zero-Leak Isolation."**

Sidelith is the **Sovereign Middleware** that sits between You and your AI tools (Cursor, VS Code, CLI). It doesn't replace them; it **feeds** them.

We act as your **Local Chief of Staff**, managing:
1.  **Context**: We proactively load the *right* files and strategy before you even ask.
2.  **Memory**: We remember your architectural decisions so you don't have to repeat them.
3.  **Security**: We sanitize your code *before* it hits the cloud.
4.  **Collective Wisdom**: We share strategic mandates across *all* your projects via the **Universal Mesh**.

## 🤝 The Best Friend Strategy (Symbiosis)

We are not competing with Cursor or Claude. We are their **Intel Source**.

1.  **The Context Booster**: Open a chat, and Sidelith injects your *derived* project strategy into the prompt. No more "I forgot what library we use."
2.  **The Safety Net**: Before you paste that code, Sidelith's **Pulse Engine** checks it for secrets and architectural violations.
3.  **The Constant Brain**: When APIs fail (Groq/OpenAI), Sidelith manages the failover so you never stop coding.

## 🛡️ The Sovereign Moats (Why We Win)

We don't compete on "Editor Features." We compete on **The Brain**.

1.  **🏰 The Governance Moat (Constitutional Monarchy)**
    *   **The Strategy**: We don't have settings; we have **Laws** (`.side/rules/`) that you negotiate with the AI.
    *   **The Tech (Pulse Engine)**: A **<1ms latency** local rule engine that blocks secrets and architectural violations *before* they leave your laptop.
    *   **Result**: You are not a typist; you are the **Monarch**.

2.  **🧠 The Memory Moat (Sovereign Ledger)**
    *   **The Strategy**: Cloud LLMs have "Amnesia." We store your "Correction Vectors" (Rejections) locally.
    *   **The Tech (Dual-Track Architecture)**:
        *   **Discovery Layer**: A **Fractal Merkle Tree** (`local.json`) for incremental code discovery.
        *   **Intent Layer**: A **Sovereign SQLite Brain** (`local.db`) for strategic memory and forensic activity.
    *   **Result**: Sidelith never makes the same mistake twice.

3.  **🔒 The Privacy Moat (Neural Shield)**
    *   **The Strategy**: To be smart, AI needs secrets. To be safe, it shouldn't have them.
    *   **The Tech (Airgap + Encryption)**: Context is sealed with **AES-256** at rest. Plus, a **Sovereign Airgap** mode for complete offline capability.
    *   **Result**: Enterprise-grade intelligence with Military-grade security.

4.  **⚡ The Architecture Moat (Fractal + Mmap)**
    *   **The Strategy**: Monoliths are slow. Memory-mapped fractals are instantaneous.
    *   **The Tech (Split-Contiguous Mmap)**: A high-frequency binary store that achieves **177M matches/sec** on ARM NEON (M2 Pro).
    *   **Adaptive Burden**: Sidelith uses a **Tiny/Fat** model. High-Performance features are **Adaptive**—offering JIT upgrades when it senses "Fractal Pressure."
    *   **Result**: 100% Context. 0ms Latency. Infinite Scalability.

5.  **🌐 The Silo Moat (Isolated Intelligence)**
    *   **The Strategy**: Collective wisdom shouldn't mean cross-project pollution.
    *   **The Tech (Silo Protocol)**: Cryptographically isolated "Project Souls." Strategic Intent is locked inside project silos; Only anonymized "Technical Patterns" (NextJS, Supabase) are shared via the Cloud pool.
    *   **Result**: 0% Strategic Leakage. 100% Shared Wisdom.

## 🧠 Core Intelligence

### 1. The Context Engine (Auto-Discovery)
Sidelith is **Stateful**. It uses **Active Listening** to build the "Mental Model" (`sovereign.json`) of your company in real-time.
*   **Mechanism**: We monitor every file change to *derive* the Strategy. We don't just read manual docs.
*   **Result**: It feeds the LLM the **exact deltas** and context it needs using `AutoIntelligence`.

### 2. The Semantic Spear (Forensics)
We don't just lint syntax (Ruff does that). We lint **Intent**.
*   **Arrow Pattern Detection**: Catches deeply nested logic that harms readability.
*   **Architectural Drift**: Warns you if a new file violates the `MONOLITH.md` structure.

### 3. Neural Resilience
*   **Circuit Breaker**: If Groq (Fast) fails, we auto-switch to OpenAI (Smart) -> Anthropic (Deep).
*   **The Brain Never Dies**: Graceful degradation ensures you never lose the ability to code, even if APIs go down.

### 3. Neural Decay & Distillation
*   **The Forgetting Machine**: Sidelith doesn't just store data; it prunes it. The **Strategic Store** automatically distills low-entropy audits and stale tasks to keep the brain lean and high-density.
*   **Sovereign Invariants**: Your "North Star" objectives are protected by the **Split-Contiguous Seal** and will NEVER be forgotten.

## 🔄 The Unified Context Plane (Architecture)

**"One Brain. Multiple Interfaces."**

Just like Supabase (CLI + Dashboard), Sidelith offers **Interface Parity**.
*   **The CLI (`side`)**: Use this for high-bandwidth tasks (Feed, Audit, Login).
*   **The MCP (IDE)**: Use this for conversational tasks (Chat, Strategy).

**They share the same Brain.**
Both interfaces write to the same `sovereign.json`. You can run a heavy audit in the terminal, and then ask Cursor about the results instantly. You are never locked in.

## 📊 The Context Journey (100-Day ROI)

Sidelith doesn't just 'help' your LLM; it provides the **Hard Drive** for its **Brain**.

| Stage | Scenario | Cursor Default (3% Context) | side + Cursor (100% Context) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 1** | Fresh Onboarding | Hallucinates stack/docs. (2hr fix) | **Detects Code DNA instantly. (90% ROI)** |
| **Day 7** | Feature Build | Loses strategic intent. Drift occurs. | **Strategic DNA injected. Zero Drift.** |
| **Day 100** | Maintenance (500k loc) | Amnesia. "Indexing... 0%" | **Fractal lookup (<5ms). Perfect recall.** |

### 📐 Data Architecture: The Dual-Track System
Sidelith separates **Physical Knowledge** from **Strategic Intent** to achieve infinite scalability.

#### 1. Discovery Track (The Fractal Merkle Tree)
*   **📍 `.side/local.json`**: Distributed index nodes found in complex directories. These store file hashes and semantics (classes/functions) for **Incremental Scanning**.
*   **📍 `.side/sovereign.json`**: The **Discovery Manifest**. A root roll-up of the entire codebase structure. This is what we feed the LLM for "Discovery."

#### 2. Intent Track (The Unified SQLite Brain)
*   **📍 `.side/local.db`**: The **Sovereign Core**. A high-performance relational store for intent-based memory:

    *   **Strategic (`db.strategic`)**: Houses "Correction Vectors" (rejections) and architectural wisdom.
    *   **Identity (`db.identity`)**: Manages encryption, consents, and SUs.
    *   **Operational (`db.operational`)**: Handles high-speed query caching and the project mesh.
    *   **Forensic (`db.forensic`)**: A tamper-proof ledger of every action and terminal command.

> [!NOTE]
> `memory.json` is a legacy "Hippocampus" scratchpad currently being distilled into the **Strategic Store**.

**The Flow**:
1.  **Index**: `side feed` building a distributed Merkle Tree of code understanding.
2.  **Serve**: The MCP Server reads only the relevant "Fractal" files for your current focus.
3.  **Consume**: Antigravity injects high-fidelity DNA into your IDE prompts.
