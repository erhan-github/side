# Sidelith Sovereign Capabilities: Strategic Architecture & Intelligence

This document outlines the high-entropy intelligence layers and strategic capabilities of the Sidelith Strategic Network CLI. Sidelith is not merely a tool; it is a **Sovereign Strategic Mesh** designed to ensure architectural integrity, data sovereignty, and proactive intelligence across distributed development environments.

## 🛡️ Layer I: Perception & Forensic Pulse
*Real-time observability and environment sanity.*

| Command | Capability | Strategic Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pulse` | **Forensic Pulse Audit** | Instant file-level analysis (<10ms) to ensure alignment with Sovereign Invariants. |
| `mirror` | **Perception Dashboard** | Real-time visualization of hardware friction, cognitive flow, and git rhythm. |
| `watch` | **Neural Observation** | "Always-on" fractal context monitoring for real-time architectural perception. |
| `telemetry` | **Proactive Alerts** | Automated detection and management of architectural warnings before they become technical debt. |

## 🧠 Layer II: Cognition & Strategic Memory
*Harvesting wisdom and projecting project DNA.*

| Command | Capability | Strategic Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `feed` | **DNA Ingestion** | Ingests codebase fragments to build a unique project identity (`sovereign.json`). |
| `strategy` | **Decision Engine** | Leverage the Sovereign Context to resolve high-entropy strategic questions. |
| `brain` | **Universal Memory** | Semantic search and indexing of all project documentation DNA (KAR-4 protocol). |
| `synergy` | **Pattern Harvesting** | Synchronizes architectural wisdom across projects, inheriting collective intelligence. |

## ⚡ Layer III: Action & Remediation
*Autonomous implementation and integrity restoration.*

| Command | Capability | Strategic Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `fix` | **Sovereign Fix** | Automates the remediation of forensic violations with a captured Decision Trace. |
| `certify` | **Seal of Approval** | Validates repository-wide invariants for determinism, privacy, and integrity. |
| `recovery` | **Phoenix Protocol** | Regenerates lost project context from the immutable Local Ledger (`local.db`). |
| `prune` | **Neural Decay** | Purges "Dead Wisdom" to optimize memory density and signal-to-noise ratio. |
| `train` | **Software 2.0 Synthesis** | Generates fine-tuning datasets from captured strategic memory for local LLM optimization. |

---

## 🌐 Layer IV: Network & Universal Mesh
*Distributed orchestration and synchronization.*

| Command | Capability | Strategic Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `mesh` | **Universal Orchestration** | Interacts with discovered Sidelith nodes across the global strategic network. |
| `sync` | **Invariant Negotiation** | Synchronizes selective invariants with the Sovereign Prime network (S3 Protocol). |
| `connect` | **Infrastructure Link** | Seamlessly patches Sidelith into IDEs and external tools via MCP. |

---

## 🏛️ Layer V: Identity & Sovereignty
*Tiered authorization and data mobility.*

| Command | Capability | Strategic Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `monolith` | **Executive HUD** | A unified dashboard for long-term objectives, active directives, and silicon pulses. |
| `report` | **Intelligence Ledger** | Calculates ROI and value generated through averted risks and tokenized intelligence. |
| `airgap` | **Total Offline Security** | Toggles 100% offline inference to ensure peak data privacy in sensitive environments. |
| `export/import` | **Project Mobility** | Generates signed, portable manifests for secure project migration across Sovereign nodes. |
| `login` | **Tier Activation** | Activates High-Tech, Pro, or Elite tiers, unlocking advanced strategic grants. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Sovereignty is derived, not granted.** Sidelith operates on the principle of local-first intelligence, ensuring that derived wisdom remains the property of the Sovereign Node. no raw data is shared; only architectural signals are persisted across the mesh.
