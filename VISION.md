# CSO.ai Vision

> **Your AI Chief Strategy Officer** - Strategic intelligence that understands your codebase, business, and market without being asked.

## The Problem

Founders and technical leaders are drowning in information while starving for insight. They need to:
- Stay current with technology trends
- Understand their competitive landscape
- Make strategic decisions about their product
- Manage technical debt and architecture
- Plan fundraising and business development
- Navigate legal and compliance requirements

But they're too busy building to do this well.

## The Solution

**CSO.ai** is an AI Chief Strategy Officer that:

1. **Listens** continuously to your codebase, documents, and data
2. **Understands** deeply your technical stack, business model, and market position
3. **Anticipates** what you need before you ask
4. **Advises** proactively with relevant insights, warnings, and opportunities

## Core Principles

### 1. Palantir-Level Simplicity
- Complex analysis, simple interface
- One question should unlock deep insight
- No setup, no configuration - just understanding

### 2. Always One Step Ahead
- Don't wait to be asked
- Surface insights when they matter
- Connect dots across domains

### 3. Full-Spectrum Intelligence
- Technical (code, architecture, tech debt)
- Business (model, metrics, growth)
- Market (competitors, trends, opportunities)
- Financial (runway, economics, fundraising)
- Legal (compliance, IP, risks)
