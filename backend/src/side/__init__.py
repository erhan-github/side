"""
Sidelith - Context Engine for AI Coding Tools.

Sidelith indexes your codebase locally and injects structural context into AI-powered
development tools (Cursor, VS Code, Claude) via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
This allows AI assistants to understand your project's unique architecture, patterns, 
and conventions without transmitting source code to the cloud for indexing.

Core Philosophy: Local-First, Privacy-Focused, Performance-Optimized.
