# The Soul: Defining Strategic Metrics

To reach **Nasdaq-level valuation**, we must move beyond vanity metrics (commits/lines) and measure **Engineering Leverage**.

## 1. The Leverage Ratio (L)
Measure of cognitive efficiency.
$$L = \frac{Outcomes (Strategic Goals Met)}{Cognitive Cost (Tokens + Human Time)}$$
- **High Leverage (>5.0)**: The AI and human are in a flow state, solving complex architectural problems with minimal friction.
- **Low Leverage (<2.0)**: The user is "Vibe Coding" or stuck in a debugging loop. System enters **Coach Mode**.

## 2. Strategic IQ (SIQ)
A grade of architectural maturity derived from the Nervous System.
$$SIQ = \sum (Weight_{dimension} \times (1 - \frac{Findings_{critical}}{Complexity}))$$
- **Dimensions**: Security (40%), Performance (20%), Maintainability (30%), Strategic Intent (10%).
- **Nasdaq Threshold**: A SIQ of **90+** indicates a codebase that is an institutional asset rather than a liability.

## 3. Remediation ROI
The value retrieved from the codebase via the **Hands** (Self-Healing Loop).
- Calculated by `Hours Saved` vs `Cost of Debt`.
- Every autonomous fix adds to the **Residual Wisdom** ledger.
