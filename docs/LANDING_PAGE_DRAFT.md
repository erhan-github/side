# Side: The Sovereign Architect for Your IDE

> **Stop talking to your AI. Start listening to your codebase.**

---

## [Hero Section]
### **Your IDE has a new nervous system.**
Side doesn't want to chat. It doesn't want to prompt. It wants to observe. 
While you build, Side constructs a **Sovereign Context Graph** of your structural modifications and strategic trade-offs. It reacts to file save events—NOT keyboard input—ensuring your local privacy is as absolute as your code quality. It sits silently in the background, ensuring your local intelligence remains yours—and your code remains bulletproof.

**[Get Started — It’s already watching]**
*Available for Cursor, VS Code, and JetBrains via the Open Context Protocol.*

## [The Tease]
### **"I saw you nesting those if-statements."**
Most AI tools wait for you to ask for help. Side doesn't wait. 
It detected that **Arrow Pattern** 400 milliseconds after you typed it. It already has the flattened refactor queued in the background. It won't interrupt you now, but it will remember.

## [The Confidence]
### **Deterministic Dominance.**
Hallucinations are for amateurs. Side uses **Forensic AST Probes** to analyze your structure with mathematical precision. 
*   **Zero Latency**: Powered by the `FastAST` engine. 
*   **Zero Leakage**: 100% on-device. No code leaves your machine. Ever.
*   **Total History**: The `Event Clock` tracks why you chose Redis over Postgres 3 months ago. You don’t have to remember. Side does.

## [The Outcome]
### **From Coder to Guardian.**
Side scales with you. From your first hobby project to 1M+ LoC enterprise organisms. 
*   **The Mesh**: Parallel workers handling project-wide audits while you sleep.
*   **The Oracle**: Deep logical verification that catches bugs LLMs miss.
*   **Sovereign Identity**: Your context follows you across projects. Side knows your style, your patterns, and your secrets.
