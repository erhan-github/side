# Sidelith: The Heritage Roadmap (2026-2027) 📅

## 📊 Phase 1: The Tactical Wedge (0-6 Months)
**Goal**: Achieve 100% reliability as the "Invisible Expert" using the **Pure Evidence Model** ([LIVE_DATA_PIPELINE.md](./strategy/LIVE_DATA_PIPELINE.md)).

| Milestone | Deliverable | ROI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sovereign Ledger** | **Grand Unification** of Sensing/Cognition/Memory. | ✅ DONE (Strategic Planning) |
| **Orchestration DRY** | **ForensicAuditRunner** unification (Absolute DRY). | ✅ DONE (Operational Integrity) |
| **Logic Unification** | Unified AST Graph for Python, TS, Go, Rust. | ✅ DONE (Phase 1.0) |
| **Comment Miner** | Intelligent Intent Discovery from code comments. | 🟡 ACTIVE |
| **PR Rationalization** | 100% automated decision logs for pull requests. | 🟡 ACTIVE |

## 🧠 Phase 2: The Organizational Memory (6-12 Months)
**Goal**: Transition from a local tool to a team-wide "Knowledge Ledger."

| Milestone | Deliverable | ROI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Context Resurrect** | **XML Memory Engine** (`context_resume.xml`) for LLM session survival. | 100% elimination of "Agentic Amnesia." |
| **Heritage Search** | Historical 3D replay of logic evolution. | Instant onboarding for any repository. |
| **Team Synthesis** | Cross-repo "Wisdom Sync" via Sovereign Gateway. | Elimination of "Siloed Intelligence." |
| **IQ Benchmarking** | Industry-standard "Strategic IQ" grading. | Board-level visibility into engineering health. |

---

## 🏛️ Phase 3: The Autonomous Auditor (12-18 Months)
**Goal**: Proactive architectural drift detection and autonomous remediation.

| Milestone | Deliverable | ROI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Drift Alerts** | Real-time "Architectural Circuit Breaker" in the IDE. | 90% reduction in technical debt interest. |
| **Zombie Monitor** | **Passive Hygiene Engine** ([DESIGN_ZOMBIE_MONITOR.md](./DESIGN_ZOMBIE_MONITOR.md)). | Elimination of "Dead Code" rot. |
| **Auto-Fixer Expert** | Autonomous remediation of forensic violations. | Automated compliance (SOC2) at scale. |
| **GNN Orchestration** | Graph Neural Network for deep logic prediction. | Predictive success for architectural shifts. |

---

## 🔮 Phase 4: The Strategic Learner (18-24 Months)
**Goal**: Feedback-Driven Intelligence that adapts to user behavior.

| Milestone | Deliverable | ROI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cognitive Feedback Ledger** | Auto-learning from accepted/ignored suggestions. | 100% personalized architecture advice. |
| **Workspace Delta Inference** | Detecting intent from cross-file changes (e.g. `fastapi` + `ui.py`). | 80% reduction in manual coordination. |
| **Self-Tuning Strategist** | Dynamic weighting of dimensions (Security/Perf) based on usage. | Optimized focus for individual developers. |

---

## 🛠️ Phase 5: The Sovereign Medic (24-36 Months)
**Goal**: Autonomous self-healing forensics and remediation.

| Milestone | Deliverable | ROI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Self-Healing Loop** | Autonomous code remediation for forensic violations. | Automated technical debt containment. |
| **Recursive Error Correction** | Agentic PR generation with autonomous testing. | 90% reduction in "Maintenance Work." |
| **Clockwork Remediator** | Proactive architectural stabilization before user intervention. | Zero-Touch compliance and stability. |

---

## 🏁 The Final Verdict: "Clockwork Engineering"
By Phase 5, Sidelith becomes the **Sovereign Operating System for Business Strategy.** Engineering teams no longer work in the dark; they conduct a symphony inside a self-documenting and **Self-Healing Logic Fabric**.
