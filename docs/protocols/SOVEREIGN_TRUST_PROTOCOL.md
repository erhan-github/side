# The Sovereign Trust Protocol

> **Trust is built on deterministic truth, not corporate promises.**

As the Sovereign Architect of your codebase, Side operates under a strict protocol that ensures you remain the final authority of your intelligence.

## 1. Zero-Keylogging Guarantee
Side monitors **File Save Events** via the Operating System's filesystem nervous system (`watchdog`).
*   **No Keyboard Interception**: We do not record individual keystrokes.
*   **No Active Memory Scraping**: We do not read your clipboard or monitor your desktop.
*   **Result**: Side only "hears" your decisions once you choose to commit them to the disk.

## 2. No Autonomous Code Mutation
While Side possesses "Self-Healing" capabilities, they are **never autonomous**.
*   **Proactive Findings**: Side will identify logic drift, security gaps, and cognitive debt.
*   **Manual Trigger**: Every fix requires a deliberate user action (a click or a command).
*   **Audit Trail**: Every modification is recorded in the `Vault`, allowing for instant rollbacks.

## 3. Absolute Local Sovereignty
Your code is your moat. We treat it as such.
*   **Local-First Parsing**: 100% of AST analysis (FastAST) occurs on your machine.
*   **Sanitized Sync**: Only judicial metadata (structural hashes) are synced to the cloud for multi-device coordination.
*   **Sealed Registry**: Your project trajectory remains encrypted and private.

## 4. Professional Detachment
Side is a **Sovereign Auditor**. 
*   It does not "guess". 
*   It does not "hallucinate". 
*   If the local engine is unsure, it defaults to **Silence** rather than speculation.
