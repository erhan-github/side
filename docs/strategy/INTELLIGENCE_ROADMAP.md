# Strategic Intelligence Roadmap: The Path to the Sovereign Brain 🏛️

> **Objective**: Advance the Side Intelligence Engine from a "Passive Observability Layer" to a "Sovereign Remediation Engine."

## 1. Evolution Levels (The IQ Scale)

| Level | Name | Capabilities | Tier Alignment | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level 1** | **Static Audit** | Basic regex/AST checks for syntax errors. | **The Eyes** (Sensing) | ✅ DONE |
| **Level 2** | **Tactical Logic** | High-fidelity forensics + semantic drift. | **The Brain** (Cognition) | ✅ DONE |
| **Level 3** | **System of Record** | Strategy connected to Monolith & Memory. | **The Nervous System** | 🟢 ACTIVE |
| **Level 4** | **Feedback-Driven** | Learning from user behavior/choices. | **The Soul** (Alignment) | 🚀 Q2 2026 |
| **Level 5** | **Autonomous** | Autonomous remediation & self-correction. | **The Hands** (Execution)| 🔮 VISION |

## 2. Level 4: Feedback-Driven Intelligence (Phase 4)
*Goal: The system gets smarter based on HOW you ignore it.*

### 2.1 The Implicit Signal Ledger
We track every suggestion rendered in the Monolith.
- **Accepted**: If a finding is resolved within 2 hours of being viewed.
- **Ignored**: If a finding persists for 7+ days.
- **Rejected**: If the user adds a `// side:ignore` tag.

### 2.2 Dynamic Weight Recalibration
Side automatically adjusts its `DIMENSION_WEIGHTS` (Security, Performance, etc.) based on user focus. If you always fix Performance first, Side escalates Performance findings to TOP PRIORITY.

## 3. Level 5: Autonomous Self-Healing Forensics (Phase 5)
*Goal: Side fixes the codebase before you notice the "Broken Window."*

### 3.1 The Remediation Loop
1.  **Detect**: ForensicEngine finds a violation (e.g., N+1 Query).
2.  **Verify**: Cross-references with @Strategic OCP tags.
3.  **Propose**: Side generates a branch/PR with the fix + regression test.
4.  **Validate**: Side runs the tests autonomously in a sandbox.

### 3.2 Recursive Error Correction
If a fix breaks the build, Side analyzes the CI log and recurses until the fix is "Safe to Auto-Run."

---

## 4. Quarterly Goals (2026-2027)

### Q1: The Feedback Ledger
Implement the event-tracking system for "Accepted vs Ignored" suggestions.

### Q2: Adaptive Strategist
Connect the Feedback Ledger to the Strategist's prompt, allowing for "Personalized Architecture advice."

### Q3: Sandbox Remediation
Launch the initial "Self-Healing Beta" — autonomous fixes for Low-Risk documentation/formatting drift.

### Q4: Deep Logic Healing
Autonomous refactoring for architectural patterns (The "Autonomous Partner").
