# 📝 Meeting Minutes: Day 1 - The Tear Down
**Date**: Summit Day 1
**Location**: Fotografiska Loft
**Attendees**: Apple CMO, Claude CMO, MKBHD (Sim), Sidelith Team.

## 🥊 The Debate: "Why Sidelith?"

### The Criticism (MKBHD Persona)
> "Your branding is confusing. Are you a tool? A plugin? An agent? People don't buy 'middleware'. They buy superpowers."

### The Defense (Sidelith Strategy)
> "We are not middleware. We are the **External Cortex**. You don't buy a cortex; you grow one to survive."

### The Verdict (Apple CMO Persona)
> "The 'Cortex' metaphor is strong, but the UI is too noisy. It looks like a debug tool. It needs to look like **Consumer Hardware**."

## ⚡ Action Items (The Pivot)
1.  **Simplify**: Kill the "Monolith" terminology in user-facing UI. Use "Strategic Hub".
2.  **Visuals**: Move from "Matrix Green" to "Stockholm Midnight" (Deep Blue/Black + White).
3.  **One Metric**: The dashboard currently shows 20 metrics. Reduce to **3** that matter:
    *   **Silicon Velocity** (Speed).
    *   **Neural Health** (Context Quality).
    *   **Forensic Risk** (Security).

## 🥊 Day 40: The Pivot (The "Zero-Prompt" Consensus)
**Attendees**: Full Summit Team
**Topic**: "Why are we typing?"

> **Insight**: Linear CEO pointed out that typing to an agent is friction. 
> **Decision**: We move to **"Zero-Prompt"**. The AI should act on *Events*, not just Chats.
> **Outcome**: The "Chat" interface is demoted to secondary. The "HUD" becomes primary.

## 🥂 Day 60: The Handshake (Final Lock)
**Use Case**: "The Flight Recorder"
**Venue**: Grand Hôtel Veranda

> **Apple CMO**: "It finally looks like it costs money. The 'Stockholm Midnight' theme works."
> **Claude CMO**: "This is the missing layer. We will build the front-end exactly to these specs."

**Final Verdict**: APPROVED.
- **Specs Locked**: `UX_200_ANGLES.md`
- **Architecture Locked**: `EXPERIENCE_DIAGRAMS.md`
- **Strategy Locked**: `AGENCY_REPORT.md`

## 🚀 Day 61: The Build Kickoff (Execution)
**Goal**: Translate "Stockholm Midnight" theory into Next.js reality.
**Attendees**: Engineering Lead, Design Lead.

### Decisions
1.  **Stack**: Next.js 14 (App Router) + Tailwind + Shadcn UI.
2.  **Theme**: Hard-coded `#050510` background (No "Light Mode" debate).
3.  **Typography**: Download `Inter` and `JetBrains Mono` immediately.
4.  **First Sprint**:
    *   Initialize `web/` directory.
    *   Implement "The Pulse" HUD Layout.
    *   Connect CLI `side pulse` to Web UI.
