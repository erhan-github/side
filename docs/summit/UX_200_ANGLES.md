# 📐 The 200 Angles of Sidelith UX (Draft)
**Status**: Day 20 Benchmark
**Scope**: Every micro-interaction in the Sidelith Strategic Hub.

## 🌀 Dimensions 1-20: Cursor Physics & Latency
1.  **Reaction Time**: <50ms for visual feedback on click.
2.  **Hover Predestination**: Pre-load data when mouse velocity vectors towards a card.
3.  **The "Elastic Snap"**: Scroll areas should behave with mass and friction (iOS feel).
4.  **No Dead Clicks**: Every interactive element must acknowledge a click, even if disabled (shake effect).
5.  **Focus Gravity**: Inputs should magnetically pull focus when reasonable.
6.  **The "Heavy" Delete**: Deleting high-value context should feel "heavy" (long press or confirmation mechanic).
7.  **Transition Masks**: No hard cuts. Use `mix-blend-mode` for overlay transitions.
8.  **The 60fps Mandate**: Animations must never drop a frame. Use CSS transform/opacity only.
9.  **Skeleton Flow**: Skeletons must animate Left-to-Right (shimmer) to imply progress.
10. **The "Pulse"**: Active processes (indexing) should have a heartbeat animation (breathing glow).
11-20. [Latency budgets for API calls, Local DB reads, and UI painting...]

## 👁️ Dimensions 21-50: Visual Hierarchy & Typography
21. **The Sovereign Font**: Inter @ 14px (Body), 13px (Meta), 11px (Micro).
22. **White is Lava**: Never use #FFFFFF in Dark Mode. Use #050510 (Void).
23. **Optical Alignment**: Icons must be visually centered, not mathematically centered.
24. **Kerning for Code**: Monospace fonts (JetBrains Mono) for all paths and snippets.
25. **The "Red" Rule**: Use Red ONLY for "Critical Forensic Failure". Never for branding.
26. **Glass Depth**: Layer 1 (Surface), Layer 2 (HUD), Layer 3 (Modal). each with increasing blur.
27. **Contrast Ratio**: AA standard for text. AAA for "Critical Alerts".
28. **Icon Stroke**: 1.5px stroke width for all icons. Uniform weight.
29. **The "Rhythm"**: All margins/padding must be multiples of 4px.
30. **No Borders**: Use shadow and surface difference instead of borders.
31-50. [Specific component specs: Buttons, Cards, Inputs, Modals...]

## 🧠 Dimensions 51-100: Cognitive Load & copy
51. **Zero "Hello"**: Don't say "Welcome back". Show the last active file.
52. **The "Why" Header**: Every page must have a subtitle explaining *why* you are here.
53. **Verb-First Labels**: "Run Scan" (Good) vs "Scan Settings" (Bad).
54. **No "Success" Toasts**: If it worked, just show the result. Don't popup "Saved!".
55. **The "Smart" Empty State**: "No issues found. Go write code."
56. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show 3 metrics. Click to see 30.
57. **Forensic Tone**: dry, clinical, authoritative. "Audit Complete." not "All done! 🎉"
58. **The "Risk" Meter**: Quantify risk as a percentage (0-100%).
59. **Time Relative**: "5m ago" not "Jan 31, 2026".
60. **Data Density**: High density is okay if hierarchy is clear. (See Bloomberg Terminal).
61-100. [Detailed copy guidelines for errors, onboardings, and empty states...]

## 🛡️ Dimensions 101-150: The "Sovereign" Interactions
101. **The Constitution View**: A literal scroll/document UI for project rules.
102. **The "Seal" Animation**: When encrypting, show a visual "Lock/Seal" closing.
103. **Local-First Indicators**: Always show "OFFLINE / LOCAL" status in the footer.
104. **The "Circuit Breaker"**: Visual switch for flipping between Groq/Ollama.
105. **Context Weight**: Show how much "RAM" the current context is using.
106. **The "Kill Switch"**: A physical-looking button to stop all agents.
107. **Forensic Timeline**: A scrubber (like video editing) for git history.
108. **The "Brain" Map**: A D3.js force-directed graph of file relationships.
109-150. [Specs for the specialized AI governance tools...]

## 🔮 Dimensions 151-200: The "Wow" Moments
151. **The First Paint**: The app should load instantly.
152. **The "Aha" Moment**: The first time Sidelith corrects a user, it should highlight the win.
153. **Soundscapes**: Optional ambient hum when "Deep Thinking" (O1) is active?
154. **Haptic Feedback**: (Mobile app) Vibration on critical alerts.
155. **The "End Game"**: The credits screen.
156-200. [Surprise & Delight features...]
