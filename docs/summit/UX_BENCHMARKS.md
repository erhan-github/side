# 📐 UX Benchmarks: The "Perfect" 200 Angles
**Objective**: To define the "Sidelith Feel" by stealing from the gods.

## 1. The "Linear" Standard (Speed & Physics)
*   **The Angle**: *Interaction Physics*.
*   **Why**: Linear feels faster than thought.
*   **Sidelith Adoption**:
    *   **The 100ms Rule**: No interaction (click, hover, command) takes >100ms.
    *   **Keyboard Sovereignty**: Every pixel is reachable via `Cmd+K`.
    *   **The "Snap"**: UI elements don't just stop; they land with a sub-pixel elastic snap.

## 2. The "Apple" Standard (Legibility & Calm)
*   **The Angle**: *Typographic Authority*.
*   **Why**: Apple sells confidence through whitespace.
*   **Sidelith Adoption**:
    *   **The "Sovereign Font"**: Use Inter or a custom fork. Weights: 400 (Body), 500 (UI), 600 (Header).
    *   **Glassmorphism 3.0**: Subtle background blurs that imply depth without clutter.
    *   **Dark Mode First**: The "Stockholm Night" theme – deep void blacks, neon accent scars.

## 3. The "Vercel" Standard (Information Density)
*   **The Angle**: *Dense but Clear*.
*   **Why**: Developers need data, not fluff.
*   **Sidelith Adoption**:
    *   **The HUD (Heads-Up Display)**: A dashboard that looks like a cockpit, not a webpage.
    *   **Bento Grids**: Organizing "Silicon Velocity", "Neural Health", and "Forensics" in adaptive grid cards.

## 🏗️ The 200 Angles (Sample - First 10)
1.  **Cursor Feel**: Custom CSS cursor? No. Native but context-aware.
2.  **Hover Latency**: 0ms. Pre-fetch on hover.
3.  **Scroll Friction**: Native momentum, no scroll-jacking.
4.  **Loader Ethics**: Never show a spinner. Show a skeleton or a progress bar. "Spinners are for people who don't know how long it takes."
5.  **The "Empty State"**: An empty project should look like a fresh notebook, not a desert.
6.  **Error Messages**: Don't say "Error". Say "Forensic Anomaly Detected" and offer a fix.
7.  **Command Palette**: The center of the universe. `Cmd+K` > Everything.
8.  **Sound Design**: Subtle clicks (haptic approximations) for key confirmations? (Debatable).
9.  **Micro-Copy**: "Initializing..." -> "Waking the Neural Link..."
10. **The Favicon**: Must be distinctive even at 16x16px. The "Sovereign Eye".
